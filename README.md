### Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Cris H. 

In here I have lots of projects I've been working on throughout the years. To the date this README was last updated I've been working with the **LEMP** task for a little bit over 10 years now! Even after all that time I still feel I don't know anything, with how fast technology evolves, so my favorite activity is always learning.

Many old projects are here, but I also enjoy showcasing my new ones. It's a cool way of helping myself know that I'm not the same developer today that I was yesterday.

At my heart lies a special love for PHP of course, being my main language for a decade now. However, I'm polyamorous with my languages, and have had lots of both fun and frustrating development experiences with TypeScript, Pawn, Lua, C#, C++, and a few other things.

To be honest, you'll find much more of my work over at the `lifespikes` GitHub organization used for my dev shop, as well as other amazing utilities published by our talented engineers.
